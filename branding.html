    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>
   Jitter Juice’s color palette, built around CMYK-inspired tones: cyan, magenta, yellow, and navy blue—was carefully chosen to reflect the brand’s bridge between physical and digital experiences. The bright, energetic cyan, magenta, and yellow evoke a sense of creativity and playfulness, capturing the brand’s lively personality in real world touchpoints like packaging, murals, and in store displays. Navy blue acts as a grounding relational color, providing contrast and stability while connecting the more vibrant hues, much like the way Jitter Juice connects its physical products to a broader lifestyle experience.
    </p>
    <p>
 This palette also mirrors the transition between the physical and digital realms, aligning perfectly with the brand’s purpose. The CMYK foundation references the world of printing and tangible materials, while the bold, modern application of these colors translates seamlessly into digital channels such as social media, apps, and interactive content. By using a color system that feels equally at home in both spaces, Jitter Juice reinforces its identity as a brand that energizes consumers wherever they encounter it, making every interaction visually cohesive, playful, and distinctly memorable.

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
    Jitter Juice’s typography was chosen to reflect both personality and functionality, starting with the primary type, New Kansas Bold. Its rounded, friendly letterforms perfectly complement the playful energy of the Jitter Bug mascot, creating a welcoming and approachable tone across all brand communications. The boldness ensures strong visibility and presence, whether on packaging, signage, or digital media, while the subtle roundness conveys warmth and accessibility, reinforcing the brand’s inviting and engaging nature.
    </p>
    <p>
    The secondary type, Area Normal Black, serves as a clean, legible counterpoint to the expressive primary font. As a modern sans serif, it supports universal design principles, ensuring that all written content is easy to read across formats and audiences. By pairing New Kansas Bold with Area Normal Black, Jitter Juice balances character with clarity, combining visual personality with functional readability to maintain a consistent, professional, and approachable brand voice in both physical and digital contexts.

    <h2>Mixed Media</h2>
    <p>
  Jitter Juice’s use of mixed media imagery reflects the energetic, eclectic nature of urban environments. By blending real life textures, street elements, and dynamic photography with its playful illustrative character, the brand mirrors the layered visuals found in city spaces. This combination captures the movement, grit, and vibrancy of everyday urban life, creating a visual identity that feels modern and culturally connected.
    </p>
    <p>
   Pairing the Jitter Bug with mixed media imagery also deepens consumer engagement. Seeing the character interact with tangible environments perched on a building ledge, dancing across a crosswalk, or popping out of a coffee cup makes the mascot feel alive and part of the consumer’s world. This fusion helps bridge the gap between imagination and reality, giving customers a sense of authenticity while maintaining the brand’s playful personality.
