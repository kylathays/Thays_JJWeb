    <h1>About Jitter Juice</h1>
    <p>48 random coffee drinkers & cafe visitors were surveyed to populate the most requested coffee recipes to make at home. A survey was posted in three different  anonymous coffee shop bulletinboards. They will not be named for legal reasons. Each applicant was asked about their favorite flavor notes, sweet or bitter preferences, and most importantly, why they choose to buy coffee everyday instead of making it at home. </p>
        <p>Based on the results, Jitter Juice was created to encourage coffee drinkers to save money, get creative and build drinks at home. Jitter Juice is not intended to take over the coffee industry, but to form new communities in interest of coffee craftsmanship. Various starter recipes have been crafted as a startup for at home baristas, and from there, takes submissions from the community to build upon. Those interested in the community can submit photos or ideas through the social media @jitterjuiceco.</p>
        <p>As the community grows, Jitter Juice aims to become more than just a source of recipes, it strives to be a hub for learning, sharing, and connecting over a mutual appreciation for great coffee. Through step-by-step guides, seasonal drink challenges, and spotlight features on community submissions, Jitter Juice encourages both beginners and enthusiasts to experiment with new techniques and flavors. By housing a supportive space where creativity thrives, the project hopes to empower individuals to take pride in their at home brewing journey while celebrating the diverse ways people enjoy their daily cup.</p>
